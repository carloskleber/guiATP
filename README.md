A GUI for ATP (Alternative Transient Program)

## Motivation

ATP is a "universal program system for digital simulation of transient phenomena of electromagnetic as well as electromechanical nature" (https://www.eeug.org/index.php/about-eeug/about-atp). It's a well established software in the power system community, and it's free to use under a specific license (https://www.eeug.org/index.php/how-to/be-licenced).

The software itself is very "old fashioned", and the user need to resort to a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the circuits and the output. The usual one is the ATPDraw (https://www.atpdraw.net/). Despite the regular updates, still the GUi is a bit old, too.

Nowadays it's near imposible to sort out these two softwares, ATP and ATPDraw from the common user, but I think the GUI could be better. So, as a side project, I decide to propose a alternative GUI, with no pretense to be better, just different.

Also, this is my first public project, so if you reach me and read this text, thank you!
